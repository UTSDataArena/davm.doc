This is the [UTS Data Arena](http://www.uts.edu.au/partners-and-community/initiatives/data-arena/overview) Virtual Machine documentation, read the [User Guide]({filename}userguide.md) to learn more about the project.

Some **demos/examples** are included and can be started [here](http://127.0.0.1:8002), or by using the Demos link in the navigation banner above.

You can use one of the existing pipelines explained in [Quickstart]({filename}quickstart.md) to visualize your data.
If your data does not fit into an existing [Pipeline]({filename}pipelines.md), read more about it and create your own based on our framework.
More information about the backend is provided in [Software]({filename}software.md).
You are welcome to [share](https://github.com/UTSDataArena) your work, that we can build more pipelines and make data visualization easier.
