title: 3D Pipeline

This is a guide  to load 3D data into the Data Arena virtual machine.
The format we consider here are object models in [.ply,]({filename}/pages/userguide.md) .obj and other formats.
A few examples are provided in `/local/examples`.

1. Copy the file `/local/examples/box/LoadBox.py`
2. Change the variable `fileToLoad` to the absolute path of your file
3. Load the object with `orun LoadBox.py` in your working directory

To adjust your model, you can add several parameters, such as positioning of object and camera, adding a shader for textures or changing the navigation behaviour.
See other examples or the [API documentation](http://127.0.0.1:8001) for more details.
